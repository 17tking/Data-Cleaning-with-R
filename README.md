# Dirty Cafe Sales Cleanup and Analysis
## Scenario:
This dataset ([Found Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedmohamed2003/cafe-sales-dirty-data-for-cleaning-training)) contains transaction data from a cafe that has several issues:
- missing values in multiple columns (e.g., "Item," "Quantity," "Price Per Unit").
- Some incorrect or placeholder values (e.g., "ERROR" in "Total Spent," "UNKNOWN" in "Location" and "Payment Method").
- "Quantity," "Price Per Unit," and "Total Spent" are stored as text and might need conversion to numeric.
- Dates are in inconsistent formats.

Your manager has assigned you to...
- clean up the data,
- answer key analytical questions to drive sales, and 
- present this information to them through a visual dashboard (Power BI or Tableau).

## Goals:
### Data Cleaning
- fill or remove missing values
- convert data types for analysis
- fix erroneous vales (e.g., "ERROR" in totals)
- standardize date formats

  ### Analysis Questions:
  - **Best-selling items**: What are the top-selling food and drink items?
  - **Highest revenue generators**: Which items bring in the most money?
  - **Popular methods**: Are customers buying more in=store, takeaway, or elsewhere?
  - **Payment trends**: What is the most common payment method? Should we push digital wallets more?
  - **Sales over time**: Are there seasonal trends? Do weekends perform better than weekdays?
 
  ### Visualization
  - Create dashboards showing key trends and insights
  - Use interactive visuals for item popularity, payment methods, and revenue trends
